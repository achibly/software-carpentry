This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)



data1 <- read.table(file = "~/software-carpentry/output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header=TRUE)


newdata <- subset(data1, data1$country=="China")
x=newdata$year
y=newdata$gdpPercap
plot(x,y, main = "GDP by year in China", ylab = "Population", xlab = "GDP")

newdata2 <- subset(data1, data1$country=="Austria")
x=newdata2$year
y=newdata2$gdpPercap
plot(x,y, main = "GDP by year in Austria", ylab = "Population", xlab = "GDP")

newdata3 <- subset(data1, data1$country=="Mexico")
x=newdata3$year
y=newdata3$gdpPercap
plot(x,y, main = "GDP by year in Mexico", ylab = "Population", xlab = "GDP")

for (i in unique(data1$country)){ 
  sub <- subset(data1 , data1$country==i) 
  x = sub$year
  y = sub$gdpPercap
  plot(x, y, main=paste("GDP by year in ",i), xlab = "year", ylab = "GDP")
  abline(lm(y~x))
}




```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
